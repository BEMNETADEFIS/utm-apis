          PART_107X:  In general, operations are 107X if they are doing something outside the 107 rule that would require
          a waiver under 107.

          PART_101E: This class of operations could be hobbyists being friendly with other users by announcing their intent.
          (For TCL2nc, FIMS will reply with inform message "authorization not required" and accept the operation. For TCL2nc FIMS does not check
          whether the operation is in a preauthorized area.) In the future, a better response for 101E is
          "Notification received" if within 5 statute miles of an airport, and "Notification not required" if not within 5 miles.
