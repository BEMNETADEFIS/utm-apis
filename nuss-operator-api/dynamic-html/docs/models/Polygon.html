<h2>Polygon</h2>
<ul class="parameter">
  <li class="param-required-true">coordinates : List
    <br/>Geojson array of array of Points. Points are pairs of longitude- latitude values. If a third element is provided for altitude, it is silently ignored. For Polygon, the first and last long-lat pair must be equal; this closes the polygon according to the Geojson specification.  If the ‘type’ is specified as ‘Polygon’ and the first and last points are not equal, the data will not be accepted.
